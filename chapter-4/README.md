## Talent Search Engine
A talent search application to search developers across a city for a technology.

The aim of this application is to achieve two things:
* Learn more about Play by using its API: ActionBuilders, WSClient, configurations etc
* Understand the difficulties faces in such architectures. So that we are better prepared to address these problems going forward in
other chapters.

### Run
To run the code: `sbt RunAll`

And then connect to `http://localhost:3000`. After logging in, you may search by entering:
